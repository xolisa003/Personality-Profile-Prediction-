# Personality-Profile-Prediction-
We built a classifier that will be able to predict a person's personality based on what they write in twitter posts. We used the 16 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality types, which are given by four binary variables as follows: 

Mind: Introverted (I) or Extroverted (E) 
Energy: Sensing (S) or Intuitive (N) 
Nature: Feeling (F) or Thinking (T) 
Tactics: Perceiving (P) or Judging (J) 

A training set with rows of tweets and associated personality types were provided, as well as a test set containing only tweet posts. We predicted each one of the categories, mind, energy, nature, and tactics, separately. The combination of the four predictions then provided us the overall personality type. Our solution placed second overall in the competition.
